        <p>Unfortunately, humans have not been very good stewards of the Earth over the years. To protect theenvironment and preserve the planet for our children and future generations, we all need to take proactivesteps toward cleaner living habits. <br>

        Most of the damage to our environment stems from consumption: what we consume, how much we consume and howoften.
        Whether it’s gas, food, clothing, cars, furniture, water, toys, electronics, knick-knacks or other goods, weare all consumers. The key is not to stop consuming, but to start being mindful of our consumption habitsand how each purchase or action affects the ecosystem. <br>
        
        The good news is that it’s often not too difficult, expensive, or inconvenient to become moreenvironmentally friendly. It can even be a fun challenge to implement among your family or coworkers. Andthough small changes at the individual level may seem trivial, just think how much cleaner the planet wouldbe if everyone adopted even a few of the following behavior modifications.

        So here are few ways you can start to protect the environment today:</p>
        <p class="sectionTag text-big">1. Consume less</p> <br>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Curbing consumption can have a huge impact on the environment. The three "R's"- reduce, reuse and recycle get a lot of attention, but the planet could benefit from some focus on the most important and most underrepresented "R": refuse. <br>

        When you refuse, you say "no," which is not always easy. Freebies at events,cheap goods on clearance, the hot new children's toys or the latest gadgetsthat promise to make your life better—none of these are essential. And theyalmost always end up either in the trash or forgotten in the back of a closet.Next time you’re tempted to purchase or accept a non-essential item, thinkabout whether it would truly improve your life. If not, it's ok to just say,"No, thanks!" <br>
            
        Bonus: Refusing to allow unneeded items into your life can save you money and reduce the amount of clutter in your home.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">2. Choose reusable over single-use.</p> <br>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">One important step to implementing a low-waste lifestyle is reducing the amount of disposable items you use. By cutting back or eliminating single-use items, you can save the energy and materials that went into them AND prevent waste. It’s important to keep in mind that reusable items take energy and resources to produce as well, so the general rule with reusable is to use them repeatedly and consistently to offset their environmental impact. <br>
        
        Think about how many people you see each day drinking beverages from disposable cups or disposablebottles, sipping from disposable straws, carrying disposable grocery bags, eating from disposableplates or containers and using disposable utensils. All that single-use plastic has to gosomewhere, and it’s had a devastating effect on our soil, oceans and marine life.
        <br>
        <br>
        All of the above items (and more) have more environmentally responsible counterparts. Switch toreusable items and make a commitment to use them as often as possible. You’ll have less trashpiling up at your curb, and you’ll be helping to protect the environment in a major way.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">3. Conserve electricity</p><br>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As you can guess, we’re quite fond of this method of protecting the environment! Anytime you can use less electricity, it’s a win for the planet. Try some of these quick ways to conserve energy around your home: <br><br>

            i) Trade incandescent bulbs for more energy-efficient CFLs or LEDs. <br>
            ii) Use smart power strips, which turn off the power to electronics when they’re not being used. (Or, simply unplug power cords from the wall when items aren’t in use.) <br>
            iii) Use a programmable or smart thermostat. <br>
           iv) Maintain your heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system. <br>
           v) When it’s time to buy a new appliance, choose an Energy Star-certified model. <br>
            vi) Seal air leaks around doors and windows. <br>
           vii) Make sure your home is properly insulated to the recommended level of heat resistance (“R-value”) for where you live. <br>
           viii) Use ceiling fans to circulate warm air in the winter and cold air in the summer.</p></div>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">4. Are You Recycling Right? What you need to know</p> <br>
        <p>If you’re really passionate about saving the planet, recycling is probably at the top of your to-do list. But despite all that hard work, are you recycling right in the first place?
        <br>
        Recycling is a great first step towards reducing waste in your household. But a lot of people tend to misunderstand the rules of recycling. Including what can be recycled, what can’t, and how to treat your recycled items.
        <br>    
        Here are some things you can do to make sure you’re recycling the right way.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><u>Don’t Use Plastic Bags: </u> It doesn’t matter if you think you’re recycling them, you shouldn’t use them at all. <br>
        Firstly, these plastic bags can’t be recycled in your usual pick-up. They have to be taken to a special drop off location that includes plastic bags. <br>
        Secondly, they’re actually very hard to recycle, often getting caught in the machinery, and they’re terrible for the environment as well. <br>
        So skip the bag. Take your own with you. <br><br>
        <u>Watch The Size of Your Recycling: </u> Anything smaller than a credit card, unfortunately, shouldn’t be recycled. Things like bottle caps and coffee pods are too small to be sorted and can jam the machine.
        <br>
        When the machines get jammed it creates a big problem for recycling centers and slows down their progress. That means that the little cap you recycled could actually prevent bigger items from getting through properly.</p></div>
